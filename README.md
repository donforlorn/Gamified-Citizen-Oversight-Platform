# 🎮 Gamified Citizen Oversight Platform

Welcome to a revolutionary Web3 platform that empowers citizens to oversee public services, report issues, and drive community improvements through gamification on the Stacks blockchain! This project tackles the real-world problem of government transparency and accountability by creating a decentralized system where citizens can report civic problems (like infrastructure failures, corruption, or environmental hazards), verify claims, and earn rewards for participation. By gamifying oversight, it encourages widespread engagement, turning passive citizens into active watchdogs while ensuring immutable records and fair rewards distribution.

## ✨ Features

🏆 Earn points, badges, and tokens for reporting, verifying, and resolving issues  
📣 Submit anonymous or verified reports on public oversight matters  
✅ Community verification to build consensus on reported problems  
🗳️ Vote on priority issues to influence resource allocation  
🔒 Immutable blockchain records for tamper-proof evidence  
🎁 Reward pools funded by donations, grants, or DAO governance  
📈 Leaderboards and levels to gamify participation  
🚫 Anti-spam mechanisms to prevent abuse  

## 🛠 How It Works

**For Citizens (Reporters and Verifiers)**  
- Register your profile to start earning rewards.  
- Submit a report with details, evidence hash (e.g., IPFS link), and category.  
- Other users verify your report by staking tokens—correct verifications earn rewards, false ones incur penalties.  
- Earn points for validated reports, unlocking badges and climbing leaderboards.  
- Vote on high-priority issues to guide community or government action.  

**For Funders and Resolvers**  
- Contribute to reward pools via donations or grants.  
- Once an issue is verified and voted on, resolvers (e.g., local authorities or volunteers) can claim bounties by providing proof of resolution.  
- The community votes to confirm resolutions, releasing rewards.  

**Gamification Elements**  
- Accumulate points to level up and earn NFTs as badges.  
- Top contributors get bonus tokens from the DAO treasury.  
- Staking mechanics add risk/reward for verifications, promoting honest participation.  

This platform solves real-world issues like lack of civic engagement and opaque governance by leveraging blockchain for transparency and gamification for motivation. All interactions are handled through 8 smart contracts written in Clarity for security and efficiency on Stacks.

## 📜 Smart Contracts Overview

1. **UserRegistry.clar**: Manages user registration, profiles, and reputation scores. Tracks levels and points earned through participation.  
2. **ReportSubmission.clar**: Handles submission of oversight reports, storing hashes, descriptions, and categories immutably. Prevents duplicates via unique hashes.  
3. **VerificationEngine.clar**: Allows users to verify reports by staking tokens. Aggregates verifications and resolves consensus (e.g., majority vote).  
4. **VotingDAO.clar**: Enables token-weighted voting on report priorities or governance proposals. Includes time-locked voting periods.  
5. **RewardToken.clar**: Implements an SIP-10 fungible token for rewards. Manages minting, burning, and transfers based on activities.  
6. **BadgeNFT.clar**: SIP-09 NFT contract for issuing gamification badges (e.g., "Top Reporter" or "Verifier Pro"). Tracks ownership and metadata.  
7. **StakePool.clar**: Manages staking for verifications and voting. Handles slashable stakes for dishonest behavior and reward distribution.  
8. **BountyEscrow.clar**: Escrows funds for issue resolutions. Releases bounties upon community-approved proof of fix.  

These contracts interact seamlessly: for example, a successful verification in VerificationEngine triggers point updates in UserRegistry and token minting in RewardToken. Deploy them on Stacks for a fully decentralized oversight ecosystem!
